# Johnny's NeoVim Config

This is my personal NeoVim config.

It is based on (https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)[kickstart] and will (hopefully) grow from there on.

## Plugins

ToDo: Document plugins. Currently all installed plugins come from `kickstart` and I have no idea what they are doing.
